# Spring-Boot-Projects-

### Hey!! I am Emre. This repository contains my API and backend projects built with Spring Boot. If you're interested in frontend development and want to build something together, we can get in touch, as my designs are sooooooooooooo awful.

## First Project ::> ToDoList

### Summary: This is my first project that I published on GitHub. Yeah, I admit that it is a really simple backend project and my purpose was to learn default repository interface functions, to make connections and dynamic operations with a database and to create something basic that I can upload to GitHub. Future projects will include more advanced tools and technologies such as **JWT**, **WebSocket**, and various **APIs** (for instance, the Google Maps Navigation API).

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

| Technology | Description |
|-------------|--------------|
| ☕ **Java 25** | Core language |
| 🌱 **Spring Boot** | Backend framework |
| 🧩 **Spring Data JPA** | ORM and database operations |
| 🐬 **MySQL Driver** | Database connectivity |

## Notes

#### **1.** => I prefer using ORM tools like JPA instead of writing SQL queries. If you want to use this dependency, you can copy my **application.properties** file(located in **resources**) and adjust them with your database credentials. 

#### **2.** => In this project, I used default methods because I think that initial projects have to be clear and understandable. When I was a learner (by the way, we will always be learners) I couldn't understand many things about complicated services, enum classes and beans. Therefore, I gave you a skeleton and I will create organs for it, design a skin and buy some clothes for our skeleton in progress.
